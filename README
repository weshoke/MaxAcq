MaxAcq is a Java (mxj) objet for Max (www.cycling74.com) for communicating with Biopac's Acq server.  It interfaces with the Acq server's streaming capability, outputting data channels as Jitter matrices.

Prerequisites: 
	- AcqKnowledge software with network capability from Biopac
	- Max5 from Cycling '74
	- Java runtime environment


Workflow:
1) Open AcqKnowledge application.
2) Open Max5 and a patcher with the MaxAcq mxj object. MaxAcq will automatically detect the Acq server if it exists.
3) Enable sensor channels in AcqKnowledge either by loading in a template file through the MaxAcq 'loadTemplate' message or directly within the AcqKnowledge application
4) Enable channels for streaming (e.g. calc 0, analog 0, digital 0) with the MaxAcq 'stream' message.
5) Send a stream of bang messages to MaxAcq (usually with a metro) to output data as it arrives.

Testing:
In addition to the help file, a bare-bones Max example for testing purposes is included in examples/example.test.maxpat.
